# Rationalizability of square roots

This repository accompanies the "Rationalizability of square roots" paper.
It contains the [source code](https://github.com/marcobesier/rationalizability-of-square-roots/blob/master/NonADE.txt) of the `NonADE` function as well as a
[detailed guide](https://github.com/marcobesier/rationalizability-of-square-roots/blob/master/HowTo.pdf) on how to use it.

## What is `NonADE`?
`NonADE` is a [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) function that returns the
non-simple (non-ADE) singularities of a double cover of the projective plane.
In particular, one can use it to show that the associated double cover
of a square root in two variables has at most simple singularities.

## How to apply `NonADE`?

For all examples we tested so far, `NonADE` classified the singularities in less than a second. Therefore, one should be able to use the *free*
[Magma Online Calculator](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/) in the vast majority of cases.

A detailed discussion on how to use `NonADE` can be found in the [HowTo.pdf](https://github.com/marcobesier/rationalizability-of-square-roots/blob/master/HowTo.pdf).
